Django Collector -- collects emails
===

Django Collector is a django application that is used to collect
emails. The typical use case is a start-up that is in the pre-launch
phase and wants to know whom they should send an email to when the
site launches.

Django Collector is unique in that is provides a mechanism for people
to delete their emails from the list of collected e-mails. Full data
portability at all times!
